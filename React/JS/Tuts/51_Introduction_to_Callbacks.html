    Asynchronous: Asynchronous programming or

     example. setTimeOut() etc

    Synchronous: Synchronou programming is line by line execution of code
    from top to bottom.
    example. variable assignment , expressions, loops, conditonals etc

           ========Meta Notes========
           Your notes are mostly accurate. Here's a review with some minor corrections and additional insights:
    Asynchronous:
    Definition: Asynchronous programming refers to the execution of code that doesn't block or wait for a specific operation to complete.
    Example: setTimeout(), setInterval(), AJAX requests, Promises, Async/Await.
    Key point: Asynchronous code allows other tasks to run concurrently, improving responsiveness and performance.
    Synchronous:
    Definition: Synchronous programming refers to the sequential execution of code, where each statement waits for the previous one to complete.
    Examples: Variable assignments, expressions, loops, conditionals, function calls.
    Key point: Synchronous code executes line-by-line, blocking other tasks until completion.

    /*
    Why no parentheses after theCallbackFunction?:
    In JavaScript, when passing a function as an argument to another function, you don't use parentheses (). This is because you're passing a reference to the function itself, not executing it immediately.
    Passing a function reference vs. executing a function:
    theCallbackFunction (no parentheses): Passes a reference to the function.
    theCallbackFunction() (with parentheses): Executes the function immediately.
